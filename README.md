# What's the Weather Like?

## Background

In this project I attempted to show how the weather changes based on longitude and latitude. 

## WeatherPy

I created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ randomly generated cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, I utilized the Python library (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy), the OpenWeatherMap API (https://openweathermap.org/api), and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities.

I built a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
